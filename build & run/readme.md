## Build methods:
- use "gcc" command to compile the source file.
- full gcc cmd 
:: "gcc filename.c -Wall -o filename.output -lm" 
:: Wall check for errors 
:: while "lm" is only for linking, eg: math.h

- "gcc source.c" for standard build and "ren name.exe newName.exe"
:: Can also be used for quick build and rename

## Run cmds
- use "./filename.exe" or "./filename" if you are using vs.code's terminal
- use "main.exe" or "main" if you are using default terminal
